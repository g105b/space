A universal coordinate system for hierarchical location of any celestial object.

Just a little toy I'm playing with... it's currently in development and may never get finished.

+ Multiverse ID.
+ Universal Sector Coordinates - USC scale: -inf:+inf universal sectors - 0,0 has the Milky Way in the centre. 1 universal sector is 12,000 kpc square.
+ Lightyear Grid Coordinates - LGC scale: -100:+100 - each cell is 60kpc square (195,695 light years). The Milky Way is 170,000 light years in diameter, so is just contained within the centre cell. 1 kiloparsec is equal to 3,261.6 light years (3,261.6 * 60 = 195,696). Selecting a LGC of 0,0 within USC 0,0 will clearly show the spirals of the Milky Way.
+ Galactic Grid Coordinates - GGC scale: -30:+30kpc - each GGC cell is 3,261 lightyears square, which is equal to 1 kiloparsec.
+ Sub-galactic Grid Coordinates - SGC scale: -100:+100Mau. The Origin Solar System is 100,000 au (0.1 Mau) in diameter.
+ Solar System Coordinates - +0:+1Mau,-180:+180deg. Measured in Distance, Longitude (au, degrees) from the central point (star, or average position of multiple stars). There is no latitude measurement as this game depicts all of space as a single 2d plane. Maximum distance from centre is 1,031,324au (just over 1Mau). Systems larger than this become distributed systems and physically require multiple stars, otherwise they become black holes.
+ Orbital distance (planets only). When the SSC is aligned with a planet's orbit, the orbital distance plays a role in visiting/interacting with satellites of planets. Measured in km, an OD of 0km enters the planet.
+ Global Positioning System - alt,lon,lat. Measured in metres, degrees, degrees. Locates any item on the surface of a planet at a particular altitude.
